i was crying a little yesterday night, overwhelmed with some emotion and stuff, and then i saw my self in the mirror with lip filler and makeup running and i looked so ridiculous

so when i see you again, i have to wear like waterproof eye liner and stuff lol

i shouldnt admit this ... i was crying again today bc i was like i really want you to see my ass one day bc its amazing but there are starving people with real problems all over the world so my problem is very small compared to theirs, i was crying for a bunch of random reasons, not really random tho. im okay, im fine, i havent really cried in a while so thats prolly why, its whatever, got it out of my system before work tomorrow
